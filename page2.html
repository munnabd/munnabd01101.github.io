<h2 style="color:orange"><br><b><i>Your Favourite Past-Times</i></b></h2>

	<p>Listening to music. I listen to it practically all day long, either in the background to relax, or right up front and loud to enjoy it if nothing else is going on. I even have it playing while I'm doing homework, that way I can't hear the TV and get distracted, and I can actually concentrate better.This is just a recent development, though, which is weird. I used to rarely listen to music, except for playing classical music on the piano and sometimes every so often listening to it.I Tunes reports 5:15:50 worth of music (48 songs). Should be improving that soon.</p><br>

<h2 style="color:orange"><b><i>Your Favourite Sports</i></b></h2>
	<p>Everyone has a favorite sport; my favorite sport is football. I love the game of football, it is a fun game to watch and play. The game is also a physical game to play; I love to be physical. That’s probably why I like it; also, football brings people together. There’s nothing better than getting together on thanksgiving to watch football. I like every sport, but football is my favorite because of the love I have for the game, the physicality of the game, and the way the game brings people together.</p><br>
