<h2 style="color:orange"><br><b><i>Your Favourite Past-Times</i></b></h2>

	<p>Listening to music. I listen to it practically all day long, either in the background to relax, or right up front and loud to enjoy it if nothing else is going on. I even have it playing while I'm doing homework, that way I can't hear the TV and get distracted, and I can actually concentrate better.This is just a recent development, though, which is weird. I used to rarely listen to music, except for playing classical music on the piano and sometimes every so often listening to it.I Tunes reports 5:15:50 worth of music (48 songs).

<h2 style="color:orange"><b><i>Your Favourite Sports</i></b></h2>
	<p>Everyone has a favorite sport; my favorite sport is football. I love the game of football, it is a fun game to watch and play. The game is also a physical game to play; I love to be physical.

Books can be long, short, big or small. Books can have a mixture of pictures and hundreds upon hundreds of words. Books can be exciting, scary, thrilling and confusing. But, above all, books can be interesting.</p><br>

<h2 style="color:orange"><b><i>Your Favourite Movies</i></b></h2>
	<p>Movies are dreams I see with eyes wide open. That’s what I do. I watch movies to shut out the voice inside me for an hour or two. I set sail for another existence leaving behind the whirlpool of funk, noise and broken air-conditioning. The allure of undiscovered places is irresistible as it is fascinating. Over the years, I have discovered many places, beautiful and captivating, full of life and spring. I have brought back shiny postcards to remind myself of the journey…</p><br>
